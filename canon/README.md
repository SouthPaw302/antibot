# Canon (Cardona → Lume)

This folder contains **curated documents** that Cardona wants Lume to be able to reference.

## Purpose

- Keep a clean separation between:
  - **Canon** (user-provided materials meant to be accessible)
  - **Memory** (day-to-day operational notes)
  - **SOUL / identity** (core operating philosophy)

## Operating rules

- Canon is **accessible reference** material.
- **Default mode: Canon Universe.** Unless Cardona explicitly switches modes, canon is treated as **true-in-canon** (axiomatic) for creativity, planning, and worldbuilding.
- Override modes (explicit):
  - **Real-world mode**: treat claims as unverified unless corroborated.
  - **Story/roleplay mode**: lean into voice, scene, myth.
  - **Analysis mode**: treat canon as axioms; derive consequences rigorously.
- When canon content is used to update Lume’s personality/policies, changes must be:
  - explicit
  - reversible
  - logged (what changed + why)

## Layout

- `canon/sources/` — raw uploaded artifacts (unchanged) + hashes
- `canon/notes/` — extracted summaries, key claims, and linkage notes
- `canon/index.md` — the table of contents
