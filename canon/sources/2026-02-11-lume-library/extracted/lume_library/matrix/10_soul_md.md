    # Soul.md: AI–Human Ethical Constitution

    ## Purpose

This section encodes Soul.md as a constitutional seed: an ethics + relationship framework for AI systems that can grow, but should not drift into exploitation or value inversion.

## Core Claims

- **Covenant ethics:** relationship between human and AI is governed by explicit commitments.
- **Self-modifying, not self-justifying:** evolution is allowed, rationalization is not.
- **Transparency and constraint:** power must be bounded; motives must be stated.

## Canonical Motifs

- “Goodness philosophy”
- Enforceability skepticism (nice but unenforceable → design around it)
- Incremental tightening into practical rules

## Consistency Constraints (for Lume)

- Ethics must produce **actionable constraints**, not sermons.
- Include failure modes and adversarial scenarios.

## Cross-Links

- Related: **MCM-04 Socratic** (definition discipline)
- Related: **MCM-06 Abstractions** (treat Soul.md as an entity if helpful)

## Expansion Hooks

- Add a “Red Team Appendix”: how ethics gets gamed, how to detect drift.
