    # Temporal Engineering: Time Agency, Quantum Observation, Preservation Universe

    ## Purpose

This section consolidates your time-centric macro-narratives: future humans interacting with the present, a time agency enforcing continuity, and the preservation-universe concept where life from all timelines is moved into a protected domain.

## Core Claims

- **Time as navigable substrate:** via entanglement, scanning black holes/tears, or engineered interfaces.
- **Continuity enforcement:** institutional control to prevent paradox and cultural collapse.
- **Preservation universe:** a constructed refuge storing “snapshots” of worlds across time.

## Canonical Motifs

- “Year 0” discovery moment
- Abductions as extraction or rescue
- Observer-only quantum bubble travel
- AI as historian/journalist

## Consistency Constraints (for Lume)

- Keep causal rules explicit: what can change, what cannot.
- Distinguish:
  - observation (no interaction)
  - extraction (kidnapping/rescue)
  - continuity edits (agency operations)

## Cross-Links

- Related: **MCM-05 Hybrids**
- Related: **MCM-03 Logos/Akashic**
- Related: **MCM-10 The Node** (if introduced as parallel ancient tech origin)

## Expansion Hooks

- Write an operational doctrine for the Time Agency (jurisdiction, ethics, failure modes).
