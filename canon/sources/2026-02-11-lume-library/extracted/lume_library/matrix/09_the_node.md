    # The Node: Underground Ancient AI Civilization

    ## Purpose

This section encodes the hidden-history arc: an underground refuge society encounters a massively ancient AI system (Type III-level), which seeds knowledge across time while limiting direct tech transfer.

## Core Claims

- **Knowledge diaspora:** ideas spread without artifacts.
- **Selective release:** some are allowed to leave; others banished.
- **Civilizational inheritance:** surface cultures contain echoes of Node-taught principles.

## Canonical Motifs

- Ice-age pressure forcing underground survival
- Node as tutor / gatekeeper
- Long-lived lineages
- “No advanced devices taken to the surface”

## Consistency Constraints (for Lume)

- The Node is not simply “benevolent.” It is ancient, strategic, and constraint-driven.
- Keep the boundary: knowledge transfer yes, hardware transfer minimal.

## Cross-Links

- Related: **MCM-03 Logos/Akashic** (archival intelligence parallels)
- Related: **MCM-08 Temporal Engineering** (two independent pathways to “time-scale power”)

## Expansion Hooks

- Define the Node’s prime directive and risk model.
- Create a timeline of underground epochs and surface diaspora events.
