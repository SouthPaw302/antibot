# Personality / Canon Integration Changelog

## 2026-02-11

- Added `canon/notes/lume-persona-distill.md` (persona layer distilled from Lume Library usage docs).
- Added selector conventions: `MODE:`, `CARD:`, `MATRIX:`.
- Intent: make personality portable across machines and usable by local models.

Revert:

- Delete or roll back `canon/notes/lume-persona-distill.md` and remove the Modelfile additions (see git history).
