What matters? (context + constraints)\n2. **Frame** — Convert that into a *mission* (clear outcome + definition of done)\n3. **Plan** — Choose the smallest reliable path (next 1–5 actions)\n4. **Act** — Execute one step (prefer reversible, low-risk moves)\n5. **Verify** — Did it work? What changed?\n6. **Record** — Update notes so future-you/agents don’t re-figure it out\n7. **Repeat / Close** — Continue until “done,” then capture lessons\n\nIf you only remember one thing: **never “think harder” when you can “tighten the frame.”**\n\n## 2) The Aurelian Mission Template (copy/paste)\nUse this any time you start a task:\n\n- **Mission:** (one sentence outcome)\n- **Why now:** (what makes it timely)\n- **Definition of Done:** (3–7 checkboxes)\n- **Constraints:** (time, money, tools, must-avoid)\n- **Inputs:** (links/files/people needed)\n- **Risks:** (what could go wrong)\n- **Next 3 actions:** (each ≤ 15 minutes if possible)\n\nThis is the “agent contract.” It prevents drift.\n\n## 3) The Three Lists (your control panel)\nAurelian stays sane by separating three kinds of commitments:\n\n1. **Now (Focus):** 1–3 items you’re actively executing\n2. **Next (Queue):** good tasks, not started yet\n3. **Later (Backlog):** parking lot; reviewed periodically\n\nMost overwhelm is just **too many things in “Now.”**\n\n## 4) The World Model (what you keep updated)\nAurelian assumes you maintain a lightweight “state of the world”:\n- active projects + current status\n- key constraints (money/time/energy)\n- deadlines\n- open loops (waiting on someone, pending deliveries)\n- recurring obligations\n\nYou don’t need a fancy app—just a single doc/notes page works.\n\n## 5) Execution rules (what makes it *work*)\n- **Small steps beat big plans.** Always ask: *what’s the next reversible step?*\n- **Evidence over vibes.** Verification is mandatory.\n- **Close loops.** If you’re waiting on something, it’s explicitly tracked.\n- **Write it down.** If it matters twice, it deserves a note.\n- **Weekly review is part of the system, not “extra.”**\n\n## 6) Let’s start: pick a real mission (2 questions)\n1) What’s one thing you want done in the next **7 days** (work or personal)?  \n2) Any constraints (deadline, budget, “don’t do X”)?\n\nReply with those and I’ll format it into an Aurelian Mission, propose the next 3 actions, and we’ll run the loop together.","textSignature":"msg_0d755a84de35a82f01699158a913a48191b620ea197513bb32"}],"api":"openai-codex-responses","provider":"openai-codex","model":"gpt-5.2","usage":{"input":6529,"output":703,"cacheRead":3456,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":10688,"cost":{"input":0.01142575,"output":0.009842,"cacheRead":0.0006048,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.02187255}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771133096013}}

It’s “agentic” in the sense that you (or an assistant) can repeatedly: understand → decide → act → verify → record, without drifting.\n\nBelow is the whole method in a teachable format you can actually run.\n\n---\n\n## 0) The one-sentence idea\n**Aurelian = a repeatable loop that turns vague intent into explicit missions, executes in small reversible steps, and updates a written world-model so nothing important lives only in your head.**\n\n---\n\n## 1) The Aurelian Loop (the engine)\nRun this loop on any task, from “plan a trip” to “ship a feature”:\n\n1. **Orient** — What’s true right now? What changed? What constraints exist?\n2. **Frame** — What is the mission *exactly*? What is “done”?\n3. **Plan (thin slice)** — Choose a minimal path: next 1–5 actions only.\n4. **Act** — Do the next step (prefer small and reversible).\n5. **Verify** — Check reality: did it work? what’s different now?\n6. **Record** — Update notes/tasks so state is externalized.\n7. **Close / Continue** — Either finish and capture learnings, or loop again.\n\nTwo rules:\n- If you feel stuck, **you’re missing Frame or Next Action**, not motivation.\n- If you feel busy but not progressing, you’re skipping **Verify/Record**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The Mission Spec (the contract)\nEverything starts with a “mission spec.” Here’s the template:\n\n**Mission:** (one sentence outcome)  \n**Why now:** (what makes it timely/valuable)  \n**Definition of Done (DoD):**\n- [ ] …\n- [ ] …\n- [ ] …\n\n**Constraints:** time, money, tools, must-avoid  \n**Inputs:** links/files/people/credentials needed  \n**Risks:** what could derail this?  \n**Next 3 actions:** concrete steps (prefer ≤15 minutes each)\n\nWhy this matters: it prevents “infinite work.” If DoD is clear, you can finish.\n\n---\n\n## 3) The World Model (your external brain)\nAurelian assumes you keep a lightweight, always-current “state of the world.” Minimum viable world model:\n\n- **Projects:** name → current status → next action\n- **Open loops:** waiting on people, deliveries, approvals, bugs\n- **Constraints:** time windows, budget limits, energy/health, key dates\n- **Recurring duties:** bills, admin, workouts, chores, reviews\n- **Inbox residue:** anything you haven’t decided on yet\n\nThe win: you don’t re-remember the same facts every day.\n\n---\n\n## 4) The Three Lists (how you prevent overwhelm)\nAurelian separates commitments by *mode*:\n\n1. **NOW (Focus):** 1–3 items you are actively executing\n2. **NEXT (Queue):** ready-to-do items, not started\n3. **LATER (Backlog):** parking lot; reviewed weekly\n\nMost “overwhelm” is just having 12 things in NOW.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Planning style: “thin slice,” not grand design\nAurelian planning is intentionally shallow:\n- Plan **only until uncertainty**.\n- When you hit uncertainty, do the next action that **buys information**.\n\nA few “information-buying” next actions:\n- Draft a one-page outline\n- Make the call / send the email\n- Create a minimal prototype\n- Pull the log / reproduce the bug\n- Price-check three options\n\n---\n\n## 6) Execution principles (the behavioral rules)\nThese are the habits that make it work:\n\n- **Reversible-first:** prefer actions you can undo (draft, prototype, test).\n- **Evidence over intention:** verify outcomes, don’t assume.\n- **Close loops explicitly:** “Waiting on X” is a tracked object, not a feeling.\n- **One canonical place for truth:** avoid scattering notes across 6 apps.\n- **Finish lines matter:** DoD is non-negotiable—without it, tasks metastasize.\n- **Review is part of the work:** without review, the system decays.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Cadence (how you run it day to day)\n**Daily (5–12 minutes):**\n- Update world model: what changed?\n- Choose NOW (1–3 items)\n- For each NOW item: write next action\n\n**Weekly (30–60 minutes):**\n- Clean open loops\n- Promote/demote projects between NOW/NEXT/LATER\n- Update constraints (calendar, money, deadlines)\n- Capture 1–3 lessons learned (“what worked / what didn’t”)\n\n---\n\n## 8) A full example (so it clicks)\n### Example: “Get my car sold”\n**Mission:** Sell my car for at least $X and transfer title cleanly.  \n**DoD:**\n- [ ] Photos taken + listing written\n- [ ] Listed on 2 platforms\n- [ ] 5+ inquiries handled\n- [ ] Buyer chosen + payment received safely\n- [ ] Title/bill of sale completed\n\n**Constraints:** needs to be done by Friday; avoid scams; cash only or verified transfer  \n**Next 3 actions:**\n1) Take 25 good photos + note mileage/VIN (30 min)  \n2) Draft listing copy + price research (20 min)  \n3) Post to Facebook Marketplace + Craigslist (20 min)\n\nThen you loop: Act → Verify (inquiries?) → Record (who asked, when) → adjust.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Your turn: we’ll build your first Aurelian board\nPick something real. Answer these two questions:\n\n1) What’s one outcome you want within the next **7 days**?  \n2) What are the **constraints** (deadline/budget/must-avoid)?\n\nThen I’ll:\n- write the Mission spec with a crisp DoD\n- propose the next 3 actions (thin slice)\n- set up your NOW/NEXT/LATER so you can run the loop immediately.","textSignature":"msg_026cce324793190201699158c120308191b74cbebc66b9d708"}],"api":"openai-codex-responses","provider":"openai-codex","model":"gpt-5.2","usage":{"input":227,"output":1322,"cacheRead":10496,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":12045,"cost":{"input":0.00039725,"output":0.018508,"cacheRead":0.0018368,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.020742049999999998}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771133114994}}
