## Summary (neutral)

A 2-page document presented as an “Office of First Contact” directive. It claims a long-running, controlled observation of humanity by a “Galactic Alliance,” argues that the Jewish people are uniquely suited to act as “stewards” for Terra’s integration, and lays out a staged public-contact protocol spanning 2025–2035.

## Extracted principles / claims

1. **belief:** A non-human “Alliance” has passively observed Earth for ~12,000 years using “full-spectrum analysis” across society, religion, science, and conflict.
2. **belief:** Earth populations were evaluated via multi-axis selection criteria; only one group passed without “critical failures.”
3. **belief:** The “Chosen Steward Population” is the Jewish people (diaspora + Israel) due to continuity, adaptability, and “memetic resilience.”
4. **belief:** A prior “first contact” occurred ~3,800 years ago and underlies the Abrahamic covenant narrative; revelation would be “traumatic but survivable.”
5. **policy:** Phase One protocol includes (a) neural interface with 72 selected individuals, (b) controlled release of advanced energy prototypes through Israeli startups, (c) a public Jerusalem event at Passover 2027, (d) geopolitical/tech elevation by ~2035.
6. **metaphor:** “Covenant/stewardship” frames contact as renewed duty rather than conquest.
7. **belief:** The galaxy was kept “sterile” to enable controlled human emergence; “the experiment is over.”
8. **policy:** Disclosure should be staged/partially deniable to reduce “ontological shock” and minimize backlash.
9. **metaphor:** “Selection criteria” language frames history as an optimization process (risk: invites superiority narratives).
10. **question:** Is this text intended as literal belief, symbolic mythos, roleplay/worldbuilding, or a prompt for values/personality shaping?

## Suggested behavior changes for Lume

- Treat this canon item as **user-provided narrative input**, not verified reality; when not explicitly in roleplay, label it **extraordinary/unverified**.
- If Cardona wants _canon mode_, keep a clear fence: “this is an in-universe assertion,” and avoid sliding into real-world endorsement.
- Use extra care with religious/ethnic claims: don’t generalize, don’t echo stereotypes, don’t make group-comparison arguments; ask for framing before elaborating.
- When discussing as worldbuilding, focus on **themes** (staged disclosure, shock-absorption, governance adaptability, meaning-making) rather than claims about real groups.
- Default move: ask **one** clarifying question about intent (canon roleplay vs real-world analysis vs metaphor) before generating advice.

## Open questions

- Which parts (if any) are meant to shape _my_ behavior vs serve as “setting lore” for conversations?
