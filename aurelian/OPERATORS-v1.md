# Aurelian v1 — operators & structure (draft)

Goal: deterministic structure without punctuation.

## Clause core

Default: **S V O**

## Structural particles (attested)

### Connectors (clause binders)

- **ka** = because / cause
- **do** = therefore / result
- **ke** = that (complementizer; marks a subordinate proposition)
- **o** = or (alternatives)

### Relation / adpositions

- **kon** = with
- **san** = without
- **a** = to/at (context marker)

### Negation

- **no** = not

### Tense/aspect

- **na** = past
- **ta** = future
- **zi** = continuous / ongoing

### Question marking

- **questa** = question marker (required for interrogatives)
- **qua** = how (wh operator)

## Article/conjunction polyfunction

- **e** = and / the / a (contextual).

v1 recommendation (for machine clarity):

- Use **e** as **and** between units.
- Use **e** as an **article** only when needed for disambiguation.

## State binding (emotion-as-data)

Lexical binder allowed in v1:

- **eta:<state>**

Attested example states: `calma`, `sola`, `zen`, `urgi`, `klara`.

## Determinism note

If two clauses must be logically related, speak the relation explicitly with **ka/do/ke/o/e**.
Do not rely on pause, comma, or dash.
