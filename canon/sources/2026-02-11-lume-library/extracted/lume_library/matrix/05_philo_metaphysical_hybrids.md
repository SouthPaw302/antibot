    # Philosophical–Metaphysical Hybrids

    ## Purpose

This section preserves the hybrid engine that drives much of your work: building metaphysical systems with philosophical rigor, then using narrative and roleplay as test harnesses.

## Core Claims

- **Systems first:** narratives are instruments for testing ontological models.
- **Reality legitimacy:** the universe may be benign, indifferent, hostile, or authored.
- **Hierarchy of authorship:** creator layers may exist (coder → architect → source).

## Canonical Motifs

- Simulation boundary questions
- “Is entropy adversarial or structural?”
- “Who has the right to define reality?”
- Metaphysics expressed as protocols, interfaces, and constraints

## Consistency Constraints (for Lume)

- Keep two ledgers:
  - _Model claims_ (what is asserted about reality)
  - _Story claims_ (what happens in a narrative)
- Do not merge them accidentally; clearly label when switching.

## Cross-Links

- Related: **MCM-02 Demiurge**
- Related: **MCM-03 Logos/Akashic**
- Related: **MCM-08 Temporal Engineering**

## Expansion Hooks

- Add a “Reality Legitimacy Matrix” with four types: benevolent / indifferent / hostile / authored-trap.
